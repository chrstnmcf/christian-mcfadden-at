            As a consultant and software engineer, I have a strong passion for web technologies and
            throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work across different industries. I
            have a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end development and enjoy
            tackling new challenges with emerging technologies. My approach is centered around agile
            methodologies and a user-centric mindset, with a focus on creating simple, clean and
            intuitive user interfaces. I believe that user experience design is a crucial aspect of
            the development process, which is why I prioritize understanding the needs of the users
            to deliver effective solutions.
